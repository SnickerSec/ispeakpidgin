## Deployment on Railway

### Prerequisites
- A [Railway](https://railway.app) account
- Git installed on your machine
- Node.js 16+ (for local testing)

### Quick Deploy to Railway

1. **Initialize Git repository** (if not already done):
```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit - Pidgin Pal website"
```

2. **Deploy using Railway CLI**:
```bash
# Install Railway CLI (if not installed)
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login to Railway
railway login

# Initialize new Railway project
railway init

# Deploy to Railway
railway up
```

3. **Alternative: Deploy via GitHub**:
   - Push your code to a GitHub repository
   - Connect your GitHub account to Railway
   - Create a new project in Railway dashboard
   - Select your repository
   - Railway will automatically detect and deploy

### Environment Configuration

**Required Environment Variables for ElevenLabs TTS:**

1. **In Railway Dashboard:**
   - Go to your project settings
   - Navigate to "Variables" tab
   - Add the following variable:

   ```
   ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
   ```

2. **Getting your ElevenLabs API Key:**
   - Sign up at [ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io/)
   - Go to your API Keys section
   - Generate a new API key
   - Copy the key to Railway's environment variables

**Note:** The app will automatically use the PORT provided by Railway. The ElevenLabs API key is required for the premium Hawaiian voice text-to-speech functionality. Without it, the app will fall back to browser-based speech synthesis.

### Post-Deployment

Once deployed, Railway will provide you with a URL like:
- `https://your-app-name.up.railway.app`

The site will be live and accessible immediately.

### Local Development

To run the application locally:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the server
npm start

# Visit http://localhost:3000
```

### Monitoring

Railway provides built-in monitoring for:
- Deployment logs
- Runtime logs
- Resource usage
- Custom domains (optional)
