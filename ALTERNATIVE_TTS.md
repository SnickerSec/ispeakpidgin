# Alternative TTS Solutions

## Current Situation
ElevenLabs free tier has been disabled due to abuse detection. This commonly happens when:
- Multiple requests come from the same server IP
- Free tier is accessed from cloud/VPS servers
- Rate limits are exceeded

## Available Alternatives

### 1. **Browser's Built-in TTS (Currently Active)**
- ‚úÖ Already implemented and working
- ‚úÖ No API costs
- ‚úÖ No rate limits
- ‚ùå Less natural sounding
- ‚ùå Limited voice options

### 2. **Google Cloud Text-to-Speech**
- 1 million characters free per month
- Better quality than browser TTS
- Requires Google Cloud account
- Setup: Add `GOOGLE_TTS_API_KEY` to `.env`

### 3. **Amazon Polly**

### 4. **Microsoft Azure Speech Services**

### 5. **Local TTS with eSpeak**

### 6. **Pre-recorded Audio Files**

## Recommended Solution

For production:
1. **Upgrade to ElevenLabs paid plan** ($5/month minimum)
2. **Use Google Cloud TTS** as primary (better free tier)
3. **Keep browser TTS** as fallback

For development:
- Browser TTS is sufficient for testing
- Pre-generate common phrases when API is available

## To Fix ElevenLabs

Options:
1. **Upgrade to paid plan**: Removes all restrictions
2. **Use from client-side only**: Each user uses their own IP
3. **Use a different IP**: Deploy to a different server
4. **Contact support**: Explain your use case

## Implementation Priority

1. Browser TTS fallback (‚úÖ Done)
2. Improved browser voice selection (‚úÖ Done)
3. Pre-generated audio files (‚è≥ When API available)
4. Alternative TTS service (üìã If needed)
