'Hey bro, are you going to surf after school?' he asks his friend Marcus. 'Yeah man, the waves are great today!' Marcus replies. When the teacher comes near, they change their tone. 'Good afternoon, Mrs. Johnson. How are you today?' Keola says politely. After she walks away, Marcus whispers, 'Bro, why do we have to talk differently at school?' Keola shrugs, 'I don't know, but that's just how it is. At home I talk pidgin, at school I talk white English.'",
      "culturalNotes": "Code-switching between Hawaiian Pidgin and Standard English is common among local students.
